Hello World,

This is a repository for some of my favorite and best appraised postgraduate work from my time at Imperial and recent work in tech consulting, 
which I will be adding to periodically.

So far, it covers:

Personal, professional, and academic focuses on AI business applications, classical finance methodologies and Python for finance projects, video walkthroughs of mathematical economic models, econometric and data science applications in R, as well as working papers on the economics and strategies of industry and policy topics.


I am always eager to discuss any of the topics I cover, do get in touch at alex.mooney23@imperial.ac.uk
