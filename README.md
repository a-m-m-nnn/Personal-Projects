Hello World,

This is a repository for some of my favourite postgraduate work from my time in Imperial College London and recent projects in tech consulting, 
which I will be adding to periodically.

So far, it covers a sample of my favourite:

Personal, professional, and academic focuses on AI business applications, classical finance methodologies and Python for finance projects, 
walkthroughs of mathematical economic models, econometric and data science applications, as well as working papers on the economics and strategies of industry and policy topics.


I am always eager to discuss any of the topics I cover, get in touch at alex.mooney23@imperial.ac.uk!
