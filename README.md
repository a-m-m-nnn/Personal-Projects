Hello World,

This is a repository for some of my favorite and best appraised work from my time at Imperial, in tech consulting, and in personal study pursuits,
which I will be adding to periodically.

So far, it covers:

Personal, professional, and academic focuses on AI business applications, classical finance methodologies and Python for finance notebooks, machine learning algorithm implementations, video walkthroughs of mathematical models, econometric and data science applications in R, as well as working papers on the economics and strategies of corporate, industry, and policy developments.


I am always eager to discuss any of the topics I cover, do get in touch at alex.mooney23@imperial.ac.uk and amj.mooney@hotmail.com!
